## 🐱‍🚀 about me 
My name is Victoria Herrera, I'm 23 years old and I have a B.A. degree in Translation (pt-br<>eng). I'm currently working as English teacher but I recently started studying programming and I got interested in the frontend language for now. Also, I love drawing and reading or watching adventure/fantasy stories such as Doctor Who, Sandman, Star Wars... and many other things!
